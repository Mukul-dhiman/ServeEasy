# ServeEasy

### Brief Introduction of the Project

We made this app to help users to find the people who can fulfill their requirements like making websites, video editing, etc. In our app users input their requirements like Technical then they find the various people who are able to serve their request and their corresponding fees for that. In the profile of a service provider, there are various skills mentioned with samples and fees. And for some free services like course tutorials providers can put the fees as Rs 0/-.

### Project Goal
The main goal of this startup is to bring the individual or group of service providers easily accessible to the market where they can sell their skills and earn money. At the same time, various people and companies require urgent work to finish quickly and they donâ€™t have much time to take all sets of interviews and hire for just one work. So our platform provides them the facility to complete their work.

### Target User group
Main target user in the initial stage is the new startup who need good websites or app developer, fest organizers for publicity or website or designing the events, some upcoming singer and rapper who needs video editor for their videos and some fitness freak person who wants to get a trainer like in quarantine they can get trained by the trainer online.
After the successful implementation of these market schemes, we will spread our reach and Target group.
